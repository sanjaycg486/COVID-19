# COVID-19 mini-group project.

As part of the Master Course "Interactive Data Visualization" at Paderborn University, we need to do a mini-group project on the topic "COVID-19" pandemic.

Group Members: Varun Golani, Lalith Sagar, Sanjay Gupta.

We used the following data source to perform our task:

Dataset Name: Our World in Data (University of Oxford)

URL: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

Tasks:

1 â€“ Line graph for Multivariate Data plot: To see whether or not the measures imposed by the government are actually helping in EU countries?

2- Parallel Co-ordinates plot: To see how hospital systems (i.e. beds) in a EU countries affect death rate and what is the pattern between median age people, population, and death rate.

3- Pie Chart plot: Created for the continent of Europe, which will include the percentage of tests carried out by that country compared to the whole of Europe. The more the tests performed in a country, the more reliable the numbers (i.e. total cases) are.

4- Choropleth map plot: To see the death rate of the covid-19. The EU countries map is colored on the basis of the death rate.

Please refer to the COVID-19-Concept-paper.pdf and COVID-19-Basic-Information-Sheet.pdf for more details.

Programming language - Python 3.

Visualization library: Ploty (https://plotly.com/)
